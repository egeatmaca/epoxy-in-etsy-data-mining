                Necklace made of olive wood and resinbeautiful grainTransparent resin with red veilTriangular shapePendant fashion jewelrySupplied without chainThese jewels are poured by me, sawn by hand, brought into shape and then hand-sanded and polished. The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

                Rose Quartz Gemstone and Healing Stone BraceletSymbolic effect:The delicate pink ish-red colour symbolizes the still young rose bud, which is just about to unfold. For this reason, rose quartz can be recommended for all life situations in which a change or new beginning takes place:Rose Quartz Raw StoneRose Quartz Raw Stonee.g. at birth, puberty, pregnancy, career change, menopause, divorce, euthanasia. With ""gentle determination"" the rose quartz helps to unfold itself and to realize its true needs.He stands for unconditional love, which is without judging. This includes being able to accept oneself and so the rose quartz can help lonely people to find in themselves the comfort and security that they have been denied in the outside. Rose quartz promotes empathy, which has a beneficial effect, especially in divorces or frequent disputes. Mistrust, fear, hatred and resentment dissolve and enable forgiveness. It makes it easier to accept others and themselves as they are and thus fosters a friendly atmosphere that is characterized by mutual respect. For this purpose, it is best to place a larger rose quartz chunk in the living/dining area or at the workplace. It should also not be missing in any children's room or living room of the elderly! Under the bed, it can help you get a better night's sleep.Just as the rose is the classic flower of love, rose quartz is the stone for all problems in the field of feelings, whether it is self-reproach or lack of respect for others or the environment. To be able to give love, I must first discard the (unconscious) conviction ""I am not worth being loved"" and begin to love myself. Only then can my love be visible in the outside.Physical effect:Radiaesthetic reviews showed that rose quartz positively affects relatively many frequencies. In particular, its effect in the area of the nervous system and in problems with the heart and blood circulation could be confirmed, probably due to the manganese content. It can be used well after a ""mini-nerve collapse"" because it supports strengthening and regeneration of nerves and also on the centers of healing, charity and responsibility.It also has frequencies in the area of digestion (feeling full, liver), acts on the skin (nails, warts, adipose tissue), the bone structure and the genital organs.The bracelet is with an elastic stretch band.

            Bestelle dein personalisiertes Schmuckzubehör zB für Ohrringe in klar, eingefärbt o. in Petri Art! Einlassung v. Gegenständen u. Objekten!
        ","
                    Diese Schmuckrohlinge (mit Hohlräumen) bzw. dieses Schmuckzubehör, z. B. perfekt für Ohrringe, könnt ihr absofort als 'personalisierte Bestellung' aufgeben!Achtung! Verkauf nur paarweise! Mehrfachbestellung gleichzeitig auslösen möglich! Das heißt;Ihr könnt z. B. wie folgt Bestellungen auslösen;z. B. 3.5 (Tropfen) in der Einfärbung PetriArt,3.7 (gleichschenkeliges Dreieck) in der Einfärbung Pigmente nach Farbmischung Resini und3.2 (Sterne) in der Einfärbung AcrylDann arbeite ich eure 'Großbestellung' ab! Dazu müsstest ihr leider derzeit mit einer längeren Lieferzeit rechnen, da ich nur 2 x die Gießform hier habe. Für Nachschub ist schon gesorgt.Wichtig zu jeder personalisierten Bestellung ist, dass ihr mir eure Farbwünsche mitteilt.Wollt ihr Einfärbungen kombiniert, also z. B. PetriArt + Glitzer (alkoholische Tinte eintropfen lassen in Gießharz wie auf Bild 3 und 4 zu sehen), müsst ihr eine ""Mixed Media"" Bestellung eurer Wunschform auslösen.Wer nur PetriArt Einfärbung wünscht, fehlt dann dementsprechend PetriArt.Bei jeder Einfärbung wird wie folgt unterschieden;EinfaSemiTr = Einfarbig Semi Transparent (also von stark durchschimmernd durch Einfärbung mit wenig Farbe/Pigment bis mittel stark durchschimmernd, hier dann etwas mehr Farbe/Pigment).EinfarIntens = Einfarbig Intensiv ist sehr weit weg von Transparent. Es gibt keine durchscheinenden oder durchlässigen Stellen/Flächen mehr.Das gleiche gilt dann dementsprechend für mehrfarbige Bestellungen! :)Die Abmessungen sind ganz verschieden sowie die Formen. Kurz zur Erklärung: Dies ist Gießform 3, die 12 verschiedene Formen beinhaltet. Nummertiert habe ich wie folgt:3.1 Rauten, klein3.2 Sterne3.3 Herzenu.s.w.Also ist gemeint Gießform 3 (vordere Ziffer) und z. B. 3 Herzen.Bei Bestellung könnt ihr aber ersehen, welche Form ihr auswählt, zur besseren Übersicht, zumal die Preise nach Größe und Klar bzw. Einfärbung berechnet werden. Die Preise sind für das Paar, da diese Rohlinge ausschließlich paarweise verkauft wird.NEU bei dieser personalisierten Möglichkeit ist ""MenTie""! Die Abkürzung verwende ich auch für meine SKU und bedeutet ""Mensch Tier""! Sprich, wenn ihr sehr persönliche und individuelle Rohlinge braucht, worin z. B. Tierhaare, Federn, etc. oder von euren Kindern der erste Milchzahn eingelassen werden soll, dann wählt MenTie!Weitere Erklärungen folgen aber auch noch weiter unten. Kommen wir erst einmal zu den verschiedenen Formen in Gießform 3 und deren Größen. Ich gebe hier immer ""Höhe x Breite"" in cm an;• Nr. 3.1; Rauten in 2,8 (h) x 2,8 (b) cm, klein, breitere Seiten, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.2; Sterne in 2,6 (h) x 2,6 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.3; Herzen in 2,2 (h) x 2,2 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.4; langschenkeliges Dreieck in 3,0 (h) x 2,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.5; Tropfen in 3,9 (h) x 2,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben in der Spitze, 3 Öffnungen in dem unteren Bogen• Nr. 3.6; Ringe (Kreise mit Hohlraum) in einem 2,0 cm Durchmesser, klein,  1 Öffnung oben, 1 Öffnung unten• Nr. 3.7; gleichschenkeliges Dreieck in 2,2 (h) x 2,5 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.8; Kreise ohne Hohlraum in einem 2,3 cm Durchmesser, mit 1 großer Öffnung• Nr. 3.9; ungleichmäßiges Dreieck in 5,8 (h) x 1,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.10; Rechteck mit Hohlraum in 3,4 (h) x 2,4 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.11; Rauten in 3,8 (h) x 3,8 (b) cm, groß, schmalere Seiten, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.12; Ringe mit großem Hohlraum in einem 2,8 cm Durchmesser, groß, 1 ÖffnungDie Möglichkeiten:Als erste Variation und somit Auswahlmöglichkeit ist die Form (3.1, 3.2, usw).Dann wählt ihr in der zweiten Auswahlmöglichkeit die Einfärbungsvariante wie klar, klar Blattgold, Glitzer Einfarbig Semi Transparent, Glitzer Einfarbig Intensiv, Glitzer Mehrfarbig Semi Transparent, u.s.w.!Euren konkreten Farbwunsch bzw. Farbwünsche müsst ihr in das Feld ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu"" angegeben werden. Umso mehr bzw. genauere Angaben ihr macht, umso schneller kann ich mit der Bestellung loslegen! ;)Ab wann eine Mixed Media (MixdMedia) Bestellung auslösen?Eigentlich immer dann, wenn ihr zweierlei Einfärbungsvarianten kombiniert haben wollt. Hier ein paar Beispiele;klar mit Blattgold + helles Pigment für einen Hauch von Farbe = Mixed MediaOder Ziersteine + Glitzer = Mixed MediaOder Glitzer + PetriArt = Mixed Media (s. obiges Beispielbild)Bitte daran denken unter ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu"" die Farben anzugeben! Danke! ♥So! Ich hoffe, es ist alles soweit klar!Solltet ihr jedoch Fragen haben, stehe ich euch hierfür jederzeit zur Verfügung.Sendet mir über Etsy eine Nachricht oder eine Email an mailto.resini(@)gmail.com!TIPP: Wenn ihr diesen Artikel erst favorisiert und dann bestellt, erhaltet ihr einen Rabatt von 25%! ;)Eure Jini

            Bestelle dein personalisiertes Schmuckzubehör zB für Ohrringe in klar, eingefärbt o. in Petri Art! Einlassung v. Gegenständen u. Objekten!
        ","
                    Diese Schmuckrohlinge (mit Hohlräumen) bzw. dieses Schmuckzubehör, z. B. perfekt für Ohrringe, könnt ihr absofort als 'personalisierte Bestellung' aufgeben!Achtung! Verkauf nur paarweise! Mehrfachbestellung gleichzeitig auslösen möglich! Das heißt;Ihr könnt z. B. wie folgt Bestellungen auslösen;z. B. 3.5 (Tropfen) in der Einfärbung PetriArt,3.7 (gleichschenkeliges Dreieck) in der Einfärbung Pigmente nach Farbmischung Resini und3.2 (Sterne) in der Einfärbung AcrylDann arbeite ich eure 'Großbestellung' ab! Dazu müsstest ihr leider derzeit mit einer längeren Lieferzeit rechnen, da ich nur 2 x die Gießform hier habe. Für Nachschub ist schon gesorgt.Wichtig zu jeder personalisierten Bestellung ist, dass ihr mir eure Farbwünsche mitteilt.Wollt ihr Einfärbungen kombiniert, also z. B. PetriArt + Glitzer (alkoholische Tinte eintropfen lassen in Gießharz wie auf Bild 3 und 4 zu sehen), müsst ihr eine ""Mixed Media"" Bestellung eurer Wunschform auslösen.Wer nur PetriArt Einfärbung wünscht, fehlt dann dementsprechend PetriArt.Bei jeder Einfärbung wird wie folgt unterschieden;EinfaSemiTr = Einfarbig Semi Transparent (also von stark durchschimmernd durch Einfärbung mit wenig Farbe/Pigment bis mittel stark durchschimmernd, hier dann etwas mehr Farbe/Pigment).EinfarIntens = Einfarbig Intensiv ist sehr weit weg von Transparent. Es gibt keine durchscheinenden oder durchlässigen Stellen/Flächen mehr.Das gleiche gilt dann dementsprechend für mehrfarbige Bestellungen! :)Die Abmessungen sind ganz verschieden sowie die Formen. Kurz zur Erklärung: Dies ist Gießform 3, die 12 verschiedene Formen beinhaltet. Nummertiert habe ich wie folgt:3.1 Rauten, klein3.2 Sterne3.3 Herzenu.s.w.Also ist gemeint Gießform 3 (vordere Ziffer) und z. B. 3 Herzen.Bei Bestellung könnt ihr aber ersehen, welche Form ihr auswählt, zur besseren Übersicht, zumal die Preise nach Größe und Klar bzw. Einfärbung berechnet werden. Die Preise sind für das Paar, da diese Rohlinge ausschließlich paarweise verkauft wird.NEU bei dieser personalisierten Möglichkeit ist ""MenTie""! Die Abkürzung verwende ich auch für meine SKU und bedeutet ""Mensch Tier""! Sprich, wenn ihr sehr persönliche und individuelle Rohlinge braucht, worin z. B. Tierhaare, Federn, etc. oder von euren Kindern der erste Milchzahn eingelassen werden soll, dann wählt MenTie!Weitere Erklärungen folgen aber auch noch weiter unten. Kommen wir erst einmal zu den verschiedenen Formen in Gießform 3 und deren Größen. Ich gebe hier immer ""Höhe x Breite"" in cm an;• Nr. 3.1; Rauten in 2,8 (h) x 2,8 (b) cm, klein, breitere Seiten, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.2; Sterne in 2,6 (h) x 2,6 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.3; Herzen in 2,2 (h) x 2,2 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.4; langschenkeliges Dreieck in 3,0 (h) x 2,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.5; Tropfen in 3,9 (h) x 2,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben in der Spitze, 3 Öffnungen in dem unteren Bogen• Nr. 3.6; Ringe (Kreise mit Hohlraum) in einem 2,0 cm Durchmesser, klein,  1 Öffnung oben, 1 Öffnung unten• Nr. 3.7; gleichschenkeliges Dreieck in 2,2 (h) x 2,5 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.8; Kreise ohne Hohlraum in einem 2,3 cm Durchmesser, mit 1 großer Öffnung• Nr. 3.9; ungleichmäßiges Dreieck in 5,8 (h) x 1,3 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.10; Rechteck mit Hohlraum in 3,4 (h) x 2,4 (b) cm, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.11; Rauten in 3,8 (h) x 3,8 (b) cm, groß, schmalere Seiten, 1 Öffnung oben• Nr. 3.12; Ringe mit großem Hohlraum in einem 2,8 cm Durchmesser, groß, 1 ÖffnungDie Möglichkeiten:Als erste Variation und somit Auswahlmöglichkeit ist die Form (3.1, 3.2, usw).Dann wählt ihr in der zweiten Auswahlmöglichkeit die Einfärbungsvariante wie klar, klar Blattgold, Glitzer Einfarbig Semi Transparent, Glitzer Einfarbig Intensiv, Glitzer Mehrfarbig Semi Transparent, u.s.w.!Euren konkreten Farbwunsch bzw. Farbwünsche müsst ihr in das Feld ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu"" angegeben werden. Umso mehr bzw. genauere Angaben ihr macht, umso schneller kann ich mit der Bestellung loslegen! ;)Ab wann eine Mixed Media (MixdMedia) Bestellung auslösen?Eigentlich immer dann, wenn ihr zweierlei Einfärbungsvarianten kombiniert haben wollt. Hier ein paar Beispiele;klar mit Blattgold + helles Pigment für einen Hauch von Farbe = Mixed MediaOder Ziersteine + Glitzer = Mixed MediaOder Glitzer + PetriArt = Mixed Media (s. obiges Beispielbild)Bitte daran denken unter ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu"" die Farben anzugeben! Danke! ♥So! Ich hoffe, es ist alles soweit klar!Solltet ihr jedoch Fragen haben, stehe ich euch hierfür jederzeit zur Verfügung.Sendet mir über Etsy eine Nachricht oder eine Email an mailto.resini(@)gmail.com!TIPP: Wenn ihr diesen Artikel erst favorisiert und dann bestellt, erhaltet ihr einen Rabatt von 25%! ;)Eure Jini

Folgende Bestellkombinationen sind demnach möglich:• Bestellung in Gießharz klar (Basis); keine Einfärbungen mit Glitzer, Pigmenten, Acrylfarbe oder alkoholischer Tinte (Petri Art) oder Einlassungen von Gegenständen wie Steine (Tigerauge, Bergkristall, Rosenquarz, Aventurin, Howlith, Amethyst, Turmalin schwarz, etc.) oder Strass, Swarowski, etc.• Bestellung in Gießharz klar/Blattgold (Basis); klarer Gießharz in dem Blattgold eingelassen wird. Ihr könnt ihn so klar mit Blattgold bestellen, dann wäre das als Bestellung: Hauptfarbe ""klar/Blattgold"" und Sekundäre Farbe ""klar"". Wählt ihr als ""Sekundäre Farbe"" z. B. grüner und goldener Glitzer, so handelt es sich um eine ""klar/Mixed Media"" bestellung! Siehe weiter unten!• Bestellung in Gießharz klar/Glitzer (Basis); klarer Gießharz in dem Glitzerpartikel eingerührt werden. Auch hier könnt ihr wählen zwischen einfarbig, einfarb. semitransp., mehrfarbig, mehrfarb. semitrans.!

Auch hier könnt ihr wählen zwischen einfarbig, einfarb. semitransp., mehrfarbig, mehrfarb. semitrans.! Beispiel/Erklärung; Einfarbig = viel Acrylfarbe/n, einfarb. semitransp. = es werden farbige Tropfen mit Abständen eingetropft, so dass klare Bereiche erhalten bleiben!• Bestellung in Gießharz klar/Mixed Media (Basis); klarer Gießharz in dem nun div. Möglichkeiten kombiniert werden! Beipsiele: Kombination aus klar, Blattgold + Pigmenten = Mixed Media oder klar, Pigmente + Glitzer = Mixed Media, etc. Sobald ihr mehr als eine Färbungsmöglichkeit (Pigmente, Glitzer, Acryl, etc.) wählt, ist es Mixed Media! Weiteres Beispiel: ihr wünscht euch einen Armreif 2 mit Blattgold, jedoch nur einen hauch von Farbe, dann müsst ihr z. B. die Bestellung ""klar/Mixed Media"" ""einfarb. semitransp."" auslösen und mir bei ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu"" noch klar, Blattgold, hauch Farbe in Rosa angeben. Dann kreiiere ich eure Wunschkombination.• Bestellung in Gießharz klar/Zierstein (Basis); klarer Gießharz in dem Ziersteine / Trommelsteine eingelassen werden wie z. B. Tigerauge, Bergkristall, Rosenquarz, Aventurin, Howlith, Amethyst, Turmalin schwarz, etc. Hier bezieht sich die Farbintensität (Sekundäre Farbe) auf die Steine, da es ja auch Steinmischungen gibt, mit verschiedenen Farben. Solltet ihr ein helles Pigment eingefügt haben wollen, damit ein Hauch von Farbe dazu kommt (z. B. sehr schön Rosenquarz + weiß oder Amethyst + Gold), dann notiert dies bitte unter ""Füge deine Personalisierungswünsche hinzu""! Danke! ♥So!

            Gießharz Armreif gefärbter Gießharz mit Pigment in violet in C-Form transparent transparenz JiBriLicious Resin Schmuck Frau Frauen Mädchen
        ","
                Premiere! Premiere!Ich bin ja ganz verrückt nach Gießharz! Aber das habt ihr sicherlich bereits mitbekommen.Darum habe ich mir aber auch nun einige neue Gießformen gegönnt und unter anderem auch eine Armreif-Form: C-Form.Das heißt, jene welche Armreifen die am Innenbereich Handgelenk offen sind. Es gibt also keinen Verschluß bei diesem Armreif.Der auf den Bildern gezeigte Armreif hat eineLänge von ca. 18 cm (+ - 5 mm) und eineBreit von ca. 3,5 cm (+ - 3 mm)(Die Maß-Abweichung entstehen durch das Gelingen des Gußes und dem darauf folgenden Verarbeitungsprozess: Schleifen/Feilen, etc.)Die Öffnung hat eine Breite von ca. 3,00 cm.Der Armreif lässt sich super über das Handgelenk streifen, wenn man ihn seitlich anzieht.Das Pigment in violet habe ich zum ersten Mal getestet. Vermutlich habe ich auf die Menge Gießharz zu wenig Pigment verwendet unddaher kommt diese leichte Transparenz, die ihr auf Bild 6 ganz gut erkennen könnt. Ich werde also mit diesen Pigmenten noch ein wenigexperimentieren müssen, um zu wissen, wie sie sich in Gießharz verhält.Solltet ihr weitere Fragen zum Armreif haben oder auch mal Videos bzw. Clips dazu sehen wollen, schaut in meinem Instagram Profil und in meine Stories!Ich bin bemüht euch hier täglich auf dem Laufenden zu halten!• INDIVIDUALISIERBAR (in Sachen Farbe und ggf. Musterung) •Solltet ihr dennoch einmal einen individualisierten Gießharz + Pigmente Armreif dieser Form, hier C-Form (18 cm lang, ca. 3,5 cm breit), wünschen, kontaktiert mich einfach hier über Etsy!♥ Vergesst nicht, eure Wunschfarben anzugeben und eine kurze Beschreibung, wenn möglich, von dem Resultat, was ihr euch wünscht!

                Rose Quartz Gemstone and Healing Stone BraceletSymbolic effect:The delicate pink ish-red colour symbolizes the still young rose bud, which is just about to unfold. For this reason, rose quartz can be recommended for all life situations in which a change or new beginning takes place:Rose Quartz Raw StoneRose Quartz Raw Stonee.g. at birth, puberty, pregnancy, career change, menopause, divorce, euthanasia. With ""gentle determination"" the rose quartz helps to unfold itself and to realize its true needs.He stands for unconditional love, which is without judging. This includes being able to accept oneself and so the rose quartz can help lonely people to find in themselves the comfort and security that they have been denied in the outside. Rose quartz promotes empathy, which has a beneficial effect, especially in divorces or frequent disputes. Mistrust, fear, hatred and resentment dissolve and enable forgiveness. It makes it easier to accept others and themselves as they are and thus fosters a friendly atmosphere that is characterized by mutual respect. For this purpose, it is best to place a larger rose quartz chunk in the living/dining area or at the workplace. It should also not be missing in any children's room or living room of the elderly! Under the bed, it can help you get a better night's sleep.Just as the rose is the classic flower of love, rose quartz is the stone for all problems in the field of feelings, whether it is self-reproach or lack of respect for others or the environment. To be able to give love, I must first discard the (unconscious) conviction ""I am not worth being loved"" and begin to love myself. Only then can my love be visible in the outside.Physical effect:Radiaesthetic reviews showed that rose quartz positively affects relatively many frequencies. In particular, its effect in the area of the nervous system and in problems with the heart and blood circulation could be confirmed, probably due to the manganese content. It can be used well after a ""mini-nerve collapse"" because it supports strengthening and regeneration of nerves and also on the centers of healing, charity and responsibility.It also has frequencies in the area of digestion (feeling full, liver), acts on the skin (nails, warts, adipose tissue), the bone structure and the genital organs.The bracelet is with an elastic stretch band.
