This is where I filled a bubble in the casting!The bottom of the box (as can be seen in the last picture) is not completely regular. This is hardly noticeable when the box is the right way round and does not affect the inside.As with most resin cast objects there are a few small air bubbles on the surface of the box.

                    This box is made completely from epoxy resin. Into the lid a painted tarot card representing the magician is inlayed, and in the bottom of the box a painted skull is inlayed.

On the bottom of the lid (the side facing the inside of the box) there is one ""bump"" (visible in the last picture) where the surface is not even. This is where I filled a bubble in the casting!The bottom of the box (as can be seen in the last picture) is not completely regular. This is hardly noticeable when the box is the right way round and does not affect the inside.As with most resin cast objects there are a few small air bubbles on the surface of the box. These are mostly on the bottom edge and don't detract from the overall appearance.This is a completely handmade item, meaning that there may be some small imperfections - these add to the uniqueness of the product!Thank you so much for visiting my shop and for your interest in these items!

They are then sanded on the casting side ‚Äì which is usually the bottom ‚Äì and polished by hand in several operations, so that it is never just a pure cast. Often you can still see a little bit of the grinding tracks on the underside, which is also so intentional, because I find it nicer if you can also recognize the handiwork a bit far. I think that gives the loved ones personality and character once again.Thus, each piece is unique not only by its design, but also by the cut and polish. I also always have the impression that this kind of editing has its own ""magic"" and only through this ""life"" and ""personality"", a certain radiation arises.Some pieces are also completely shaped after the greeting, and then polished.If you have certain design wishes, please ask without obligation and we can see together what can be done :)Note: Resin/epoxy resin yellows slightly over time, and colors may fade. This process depends very much on UV radiation. Therefore, expose your Zhavaya to as little direct UV radiation as possible, and do not use sharp detergents that could attack the surface. If necessary, a little lukewarm water with a little mild hand washing lotion is suitable for cleaning.THE LIGHT CHILDSFirst, I free the original creature with hand tools from a soft stone.The grinder then reproduces them in crystals and semi-precious stones. What was important to me was above all that they can be created lovingly and under fair conditions, and that the radiance of the original being can also be found in the crystal beings.They are handcrafted by a one-man company in China, a young talented grinder - carefully, individually, and as it seems also with a smile on their face :)

Unperfektheiten sind Zeichen f√ºr die Echtheit und stellen keinen Mangel dar.Aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Darstellung auf verschiedenen Ger√§ten sind leichte Farbabweichungen bei den Bildern m√∂glich.DRACHENSCH√ÑDEL AUS BERGKRISTALL, RUBIN, EDELSCHUNGITH, 24 KARAT BLATTGOLD, 999er FEINSILBER UND BL√úTEN IN RESINGewicht: ca. 25,8 Gramm Ma√üe:  LxBxH ca. 48 x 35 x 27 mmDies ist ein zauberhafter Drachen Sch√§del, der in seinem Inneren Bergkristall und Bl√ºten tr√§gt. Die klareren Bergkristall-St√ºckchen verschmelzen optisch sehr sch√∂n mit dem Resin. Vorn an seiner Schnauze befindet sich ein St√ºckchen Edelschungith, in seinen oberen H√∂rnchenspitzen befinden sich jeweils ein K√ºgelchen aus 999er Feinsilber. Zwei kleine Rubine und verteiltes Blattgold wurden erg√§nzend hinzugef√ºgt. Das Resin/Epoxid ist ganz leicht violett eingef√§rbt.DIE KUNSTHARZ FIGURENwerden von mir in √ºberwiegend selbst erstellten Formen gegossen. Anschlie√üend werden sie auf der Gu√üseite ‚Äì was zumeist die Unterseite ist ‚Äì geschliffen und in mehreren Arbeitsg√§ngen von Hand poliert, so dass es sich niemals nur um einen reinen Gu√ü handelt. Oftmals sieht man auf der Unterseite noch ein wenig von den Schleifspuren, was auch so gewollt ist, da ich es sch√∂ner finde wenn man ein St√ºck weit die Handarbeit auch noch erkennen kann. Ich finde das verleiht den Lieben nochmals Pers√∂nlichkeit und Charakter. So ist jedes St√ºck nicht nur durch die Gestaltung, sondern auch durch den Schliff und Politur ein Unikat. Ich habe auch stets den Eindruck, dass diese Art der Bearbeitung eine eigene ‚ÄûMagie‚Äú hat und erst hierdurch ‚ÄûLeben‚Äú und ‚ÄûPers√∂nlichkeit‚Äú, eine bestimmte Aussstrahlung entsteht. Einige St√ºcke werden auch erst nach dem Gu√ü komplett in Form gebracht, und anschlie√üend poliert.Solltest Du bestimmte Gestaltungsw√ºnsche haben, frage gern unverbindlich nach und wir k√∂nnen gemeinsam schauen was sich machen l√§sst :)Hinweis: Resin/Epoxidharz vergilbt im Laufe der Zeit etwas, und Farben k√∂nnen verblassen. Dieser Prozess h√§ngt sehr wesentlich von der UV-Strahlung ab. Setze daher Deinen Drachen m√∂glichst wenig direkter UV-Strahlung aus, und nutze keine scharfen Reinigungsmittel, welche die Oberfl√§che angreifen k√∂nnten. Bei Bedarf ist ein wenig lauwarmes Wasser mit etwas milder Handwasch-Lotion zur Reinigung geeignet.DIE LIGHT CHILDSZun√§chst befreie ich das Urwesen mit Handwerkzeugen aus einem weichen Stein.Anschlie√üend vervielf√§ltigt der Schleifer sie in Kristallen und Halbedelsteinen. Wichtig hierbei war mir vor allem, dass sie liebevoll und unter fairen Bedingungen entstehen d√ºrfen, und dass die Ausstrahlung des urspr√ºnglichen Wesens auch in den Kristallwesen zu finden ist.Sie werden von einem Ein-Mann-Unternehmen in China, einem jungen talentierten Schleifer, handgearbeitet - sorgf√§ltig, individuell, und wie es scheint auch mit einem L√§cheln im Gesicht :)

It is said that all crystal skulls are connected by the crystal skull consciousness.I think the best way to discover the energy of different skulls, figures, crystals and stones is to entrust yourself to your inner guidance and do what feels good and right to you.

The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

                Necklace made of olive wood and resinbeautiful grainTransparent resin with red veilTriangular shapePendant fashion jewelrySupplied without chainThese jewels are poured by me, sawn by hand, brought into shape and then hand-sanded and polished. The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.
