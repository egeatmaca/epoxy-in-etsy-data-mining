The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

The amount of work from casting to the finished piece of jewellery is about 3 hours.So they are absolutely unique! No piece looks the same as the other.I also like to make an individual set (according to your wishes) with necklace and earrings for you.Please note, however, that due to the curing time and the other effort for this, at least 1.5 weeks are required until shipping.

                    This box is made completely from epoxy resin. Into the lid a painted tarot card representing the magician is inlayed, and in the bottom of the box a painted skull is inlayed. The lid is transparent, meaning that you can see some of the inside the box when it is closed.Dimensions:Outer height with lid: 6.9cm (lid thickness: 1cm)Outer width: 9.5cmOuter length: 12.5cmInner height: 4cm without lid, 3.7cm with lidInner width: 7.5cmInner length: 10.5cmNotes on this item:The surface of the lid is even and smooth but there are some small irregularities on the edges of the surface. On the bottom of the lid (the side facing the inside of the box) there is one ""bump"" (visible in the last picture) where the surface is not even. This is where I filled a bubble in the casting!The bottom of the box (as can be seen in the last picture) is not completely regular. This is hardly noticeable when the box is the right way round and does not affect the inside.As with most resin cast objects there are a few small air bubbles on the surface of the box. These are mostly on the bottom edge and don't detract from the overall appearance.This is a completely handmade item, meaning that there may be some small imperfections - these add to the uniqueness of the product!Thank you so much for visiting my shop and for your interest in these items!

Soll in schweren Zeiten die Liebe und Treue in Beziehungen festigen. ( Halschakra + Herzchakra )Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannTektit = Fördert Selbsterkenntnis und Heilung. Fördert neue Ideen und verbessert die Aufmerksamkeit, kann außerdem den Schlaf verbessern & bei Schlafstörungen helfen.Turmalin (Schörl) = Der Turmalin darf in einem Orgon Amulett auf keinen Fall fehlen.

Aktiviert die Energiemeridiane und somit auch das jeweilige Chakra auf dem er aufliegt.Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Pyrit = lässt über sich selbst nachdenken um die eigenen Schwächen besser erkennen und transformieren zu können. Somit können Blockaden u. Ängste gelindert werden. Löst innere Unruhe und NervositätSelenit = Starke klärende Wirkung auf das vegetative Nervensystem (Verstand und Gehirn). Fördert Vitalität und Kreativität.Fluorit (grün) = Wirkt besonders heilsam auf Lungen und Atemwege. Fördert Intuition, Konzentration und Aufnahmefähigkeit.

Er verleiht Herzenswärme und Stärke und schützt zudem vor geopathischen Belastungen wie Elektrosmog und Wasseradern. Soll bei der Steigerung des Selbstwertgefühls behilflich sein.Verbaute Metalle:Bronze, Eisen, Edelstahl, Blattgold, Blattsilber, Aluminium, Zink, Kupfer, MagnesiumSelbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz.

Let go of everything and focus on the point where the orgonite touches the skin. Breathe in and out several times and be completely relaxed. This is the best way for the plate to unfold its effect on the Svadhisthana chakra.Components:Blood agate, brass, bronze, rock crystal, carnelian, onyx, tourmaline, mica powder, iron, tourmalineImportant note❕: I make all my products myself & please take into account that small beauty marks can occur during the production, such as air bubbles which are trapped in the resin & thus occasionally small holes are created, minimal scratches on the surface which can only be detected with close inspection or minimally standing materials. However, this has no effect on the effect of the orgone and occurs only in very rare cases. Thank you for your understanding! :)Homemade orgone product made from various metals, minerals and epoxy resin. Each of my pieces is unique and therefore unique.I swear by the authenticity of the components I have indicated!For each individual orgonite I take a lot of time and put a lot of work and love in. In most cases, my products are made during the day and the materials processed in them are charged in sunlight for optimal effect. If necessary, some orgonites will also be bathed in the light of the full moon, if this is the case, you will find this information among the components.

            Svadhistana • Orgon Amulett von Sonnenkraft7 - Aktivierung & Reinigung des Sakralchakras
        ","
                    Motiv:Svadhistana • kommt aus dem Sanskrit und symbolisiert das zweite Hauptchakra. (Sakralchakra)Das Chakra befindet sich etwa eine Handbreite unter dem Bauchnabel auf Höhe der Hüftknochen und leuchtet in der Farbe orange. Es bekommt den Wochentag Dienstag. Es ist der Kanal für kreative Energie und Lebensfreude. Über dieses Chakra wird alles geregelt was mit Emotionen zu tun hat, demnach werden auch emotionale Erlebnisse darüber verarbeitet. Desweiteren steht es für verlangen/Begehren und auch Lust und Sexualität da sich auf der Höhe des Chakras auch die sexualorgane befinden.Maße: Durchmesser: 30mmTiefe: 9mmBestandteile:Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannBergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Blutachat = Hilft bei Ruhelosigkeit, Kummer, Herzschmerz und Liebeskummer. Ihm wird zudem nachgesagt, dass er vor inneren Qualen bewahren solle. Bei der Meditation soll er ein wohliges Gefühl bescheren welches die Glückshormone aktivieren soll. Wirkt hervorragend auf dem SakralchakraMetalle: Bronze, Kupfer, pigmentiertes EisenpulverAnwendung:Um das Volle Potenzial des Amuletts zu nutzen, empfehle ich den Anhänger möglichst tief zu tragen das er so nahe wie möglich an die Lage des Sakralchakras heran kommt. Auf Höhe des Solar Plexus ist es dennoch in Ordnung und sehr wirksam.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien. Das hat allerdings keine Folgen auf die Wirkung des Orgons und tritt auch nur in sehr seltenen Fällen auf. Danke für das Verständnis! :)Selbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz. Jedes einzelne meiner Stücke ist ein Unikat und somit einzigartig.Ich schwöre auf die Echtheit der von mir angegebenen Bestandteile!Für jeden einzelnen Orgonite nehme ich mir sehr viel Zeit und stecke sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe herein. In den meisten Fällen werden meine Produkte am Tag hergestellt und die darin verarbeiteten Materialien im Sonnenlicht aufgeladen um eine optimale Wirkung zu erzielen. Gegebenenfalls werden einige Orgonite auch im Licht des Vollmondes gebadet, wenn dies der Fall ist, findest du diese Information unter den Bestandteilen.

            Neck Chakra Orulet Amulet of Solar Power7 - Orgone Amulet - For Communication & Rhetoric
        ","
                    Motive:Vishudda Chakra • The chakra is located at the level of the throat and stands for truth, communication, rhetoric and creative self-expression.It gets the color blue and the weekday Wednesday assigned.Dimensions: Diameter: 30 mmDepth: 12 mmComponents:Apatite = Helps against apathy, fatigue or lack of drive. Gives motivation, optimism, determination and flexibility to make your own life more varied.Chalcedon = Best stone for the rhetoric. Brings inner peace and mindfulness. Increases attention and boosts self-confidence. Can release inhibitions and blockages. It also protects against poor sleep and nightmaresRock crystal = enhances the effect of other healing stones. Stores information and releases it through its individual energy. (peaks more suitable than granules) provides clarity and order. In doing so, it supports the calming of the mental state and a more harmonious alignment with the higher self. It also protects against electrosmog and harmful interference fields.The following metals are included:Iron, aluminum, copperInteresting facts about the orgone amuletAll orgone amulets made by me can be used in a wide variety of ways. They are smaller and more compact than a pyramid and therefore have a lower radius of action, but still have enough potential to support certain body zones in their function to protect or heal. Depending on the height at which the amulet is worn, it can stimulate certain areas, e.B the thyroid gland or lungs. I always recommend meditating with the orgones and putting them on certain areas as this way achieves the best effects. Each orgone amulet receives a free adjustable hemp cord, which can be adjusted to any height. Thus, the orgonith is permanently on the desired spot and unfolds its full potential over everyday life.Everyone who likes to wear healing stone chains knows the problem of not being able to decide which stone to wear today. So you just wear 2 -4 stone chains which can be quite annoying in the long run. With my orgone amulets, all your favorite healing stones can be perfectly combined and can reach their potential for maximum effect with concentrated force within a single trailer. In addition, the effect of the orgone is added, which by the composition of resin, metals and healing stones amplifies the effect many times over and the ability to convert negative ions into positive ions. Thus, you have solved several problems and wears a beautiful and powerful pendant that accompanies you in your everyday life.Important note❕: I make all my products myself & please take into account that small beauty slacks can occur during the production of the production, such as .b air bubbles which are trapped in the resin & thus occasionally small holes are created, minimal scratches on the surface which can only be detected with close inspection or minimally standing out materials. However, this has no effect on the effect of the orgone and occurs only in very rare cases.

            Artemis - Achtseitige Cheops Orgon Pyramide von Sonnenkraft7 - Orgon Pyramide m. goldenem Schnitt - Traumabewältigung & Schutz
        ","
                    Maße:Kantenlänge: 120mmHöhe: 80mmForm: Achtseitig mit Innenwinkel 1,7GradBestandteile:Fuchsit = dient als Schutzstein bei Depressionen, Ängsten und Melancholie. Ebenso verleiht er in schwierigen Situationen & Lebenslagen ein sicheres Auftreten und hilft dabei, inneren und äußeren Druck abzuwenden. Fördert die Kreativität.Azurit-Malachit = Bester Stein zur Traumabewältigung. Seelische Verletzungen welche das Leben beeinträchtigen können mit dem Azurit-Malachit gelindert werden. Zudem lässt sich besser mit Flashbacks und Alpträumen klar kommen da der Stein eine schuppenähnliche energetische Schutzschicht über die Aura legt. Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannBergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat/beides verbaut) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern. Wird oft auch als Master Healer Kristall bezeichnet da er bei jeder Form von geistiger, seelischer oder körperlicher Belastung eingesetzt werden kann. Ist im Orgonit das wichtigste Mineral da durch den Druck des ausgehärteten Harzes auf die Kristalle der sogenannte piezoelektrische Effekt hervorgerufen wird der für Wirkung eines gut funktionierenden Orgoniten von entschiedener Bedeutung ist.Verbaute Metalle:Titan, Blattgold, Blattsilber, Magnesium, Zink❕Dies ist eine achtseitige Pyramide mit einem Innenwinkel von 1,7 Grad, genau 1zu1 wie die große Cheops Pyramide in Gizeh erbaut wurde.Was ist an achtseitige Pyramiden anders als bei vierseitigen?Schon die alten Ägypter wussten die Wirkung von achtseitigen Pyramiden zu schätzen und erbauten deshalb viele Ihrer Bauwerke nach diesem Konzept. Nur warum? Abgesehen davon das sich durch diesen Innenwinkel das Bauwerk länger hält weißt es auch energetisch gesehen ein höheres Energiepotenzial auf als eine vierseitige Pyramide. Diese Aussage unterstützt in diesem Sinne die Theorie, dass die Pyramiden vor vielen Tausenden von Jahren als Generator bzw. Kraftwerk für freie Energie genutzt wurden. Ich möchte aber an dieser Stelle nicht tiefer darauf eingehen. (Bei Interesse können sie sich gerne etwas darüber informieren/ die Informationen sind überall zugänglich).Aufgrund dessen das also nach alter Ägyptischer Lehre dieses Prinzip für den Pyramidenbau angewendet wurde, haben sich auch diverse Größen wie Nikola Tesla und Wilhelm Reich mit dieser Materie auseinandergesetzt und sehr viel in diese Richtung geforscht.Nachdem viele Informationen zu diesem Thema gesammelt und kombiniert werden konnten, konnte man dieses uralte Wissen nun auch in den Orgonbau mit einfließen lassen.Eine achtseitige Orgon/Prana Pyramide hat somit ein viel höheres und stärkeres Energieniveau als eine vierseitige & dementsprechend auch eine viel längere Lebensdauer bevor sie endgültig “ausgebrannt“ ist und wieder reaktiviert werden muss.Die Formen der großen Pyramiden sind bis heute ein mathematisches Wunder, und genau diese Mystik steckt auch in jeder achtseitigen Orgon Pyramide und kann so auch diese Energie an seine Umwelt abgeben und sie von der heilenden Erdenergie profitieren lassen. In Kombination mit einem gepulsten Quarzkristall welcher durch einen modernen Frequenz Generator auf eine beliebige Frequenz getaktet werden kann (z.b 432hz (heilende Erdfrequenz)), erreicht das fertige Orgon Produkt sein maximales Wirkungspotenzial.Nach diesem einzigartigen Konzept werden viele unserer Produkte mit zeitaufwendiger Arbeit, Liebe, Kreativität und Herzblut hergestellt und für unsere Kunden zum Kauf angeboten. Ich bitte an dieser Stelle noch einmal zu berücksichtigen das in jedem einzelnen Orgon Produkt sehr viel Zeit, Kreativität, Kopfarbeit, Wissen in diverse Bereiche aber auch teure Materialien, aufwendige Handarbeit, stundenlanges sitzen vor dem Computer und Steuern den endgültigen Preis bilden.Selbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz. Jedes einzelne meiner Stücke ist ein Unikat und somit einzigartig.Ich schwöre auf die Echtheit der von mir angegebenen Bestandteile!Für jeden einzelnen Orgonite nehme ich mir sehr viel Zeit und stecke sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe herein. In den meisten Fällen werden meine Produkte am Tag hergestellt und die darin verarbeiteten Materialien im Sonnenlicht aufgeladen um eine optimale Wirkung zu erzielen.

            Orgon Amulett von Sonnenkraft7 - Orgon Amulett - Keltische Triskele - Mit Dumortierit & Bronze
        ","
                    Bedeutung Triskele: Die Drei Arme des Symbols können vielseitig gedeutet werden. Angefangen damit das de Zahl 3 eine Ordnungszahl ist welche eine Mathematische Unendlichkeit darstellt. Die Zahlen 3,6 oder 9 in energetischem Schmuck zu verwenden ist um einiges kraftvoller als Chaoszahlen zu verwenden. Zum anderen repräsentiert die Triskele den Vater, Sohn und Heiligen Geist, aber auch Körper Geist und Seele. Es ist ein starkes Symbol zum abwenden von bösen Energien und energetischen Angriffen. Es gilt also seit mehr als 1000 Jahren als Schutzsymbol vor dem Bösen. Maße:Breite: 17mmHöhe: 25mmTiefe: 6mmBestandteile:Dumortierit = Soll stark konzentrationsfördernd und zentrierend auf den Geist einwirken. Nach getaner geistiger Arbeit soll er den Übergang in einen entspannten Zustand erleichtern und für Ausgleich und innere Ruhe sorgen. Ihm wird ebenfalls nachgesagt das es kaum einen Stein gibt welcher besser den Geist beruhigen und abschalten kann wie der Dumortierit. Demnach findet er überall dort Verwendung wo innere Blockaden, nervöse innere Unruhe und Überreiztheit zu finden sind. Während der Meditation wird oft gesagt das Nirwana ähnliche Zustände voller Ausgeglichenheit und Harmonie erreicht werden können.Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Metalle:Bronze, EisenChakra:Vishudda (Halschakra), Ajna (Drittes Auge)Wissenswertes zum Orgon-AmulettAlle von mir persönlich gefertigten Orgon Amulette können sehr vielfältig eingesetzt werden. Sie sind kleiner und kompakter als eine Pyramide und haben demnach einen niedrigeren Wirkradius, aber immernoch genug Potenzial um seinen Träger stetig zu unterstützen. Je nachdem auf welcher Höhe das Amulett getragen wird kann es bestimmte Bereiche stimulieren, z.B die Schilddrüse oder die Lungen. Ich empfehle immer mit den Orgoniten zu meditieren und sie auf bestimmte Bereiche aufzulegen da man auf diese Weise die besten Effekte erzielt. Jedes Orgon Amulett erhält eine kostenlose Verstellbare Hanfschnur dazu, welche auf jede Höhe angepasst werden kann. Somit liegt der Orgonit permanent auf der gewünschten Stelle auf und entfaltet über den Alltag sein volles Potenzial.Jeder der gerne Heilsteinketten trägt kennt das Problem sich nicht entscheiden zu können welchen Stein man heute trägt. Also trägt man einfach 2 -4 Steinketten was auf Dauer ziemlich störend sein kann. Durch meine Orgon Amulette lassen sich alle deine Lieblings Heilsteine perfekt miteinander kombinieren und können mit geballter Kraft innerhalb eines einzigen Anhängers ihr Wirkungspotenzial maximal entfalten. Zusätzlich kommt noch der Effekt des Orgons hinzu welcher Durch die Zusammensetzung aus Harz, Metallen und Heilsteinen den Effekt um ein Vielfaches verstärkt und die Fähigkeit, negative Ionen in Positive Ionen umwandeln zu können. Somit hat man mehrere Probleme gelöst und trägt einen wunderschönen und kraftvollen Anhänger der dich in deinem Alltag begleitet.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien.

Zudem soll er Ängste, Vorurteile und klischeehaftes Denken abwenden und den Geist für neue Erfahrungen öffnen. Hilft bei Unehrlichkeit, Verdrängung und sprachbedingten Problemen.

Diese Energie wird somit komprimiert und punktuell auf die Stelle an der das Amulett getragen wird, übertragen.Maße: Kantenlänge: 120mmHöhe: 80mmForm: Achtseitig mit Innenwinkel 1,7GradBestandteile:Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannTektit = Fördert Selbsterkenntnis und Heilung. Fördert neue Ideen und verbessert die Aufmerksamkeit, kann außerdem den Schlaf verbessern & bei Schlafstörungen helfen.Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat/beides verbaut) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern. Wird oft auch als Master Healer Kristall bezeichnet da er bei jeder Form von geistiger, seelischer oder körperlicher Belastung eingesetzt werden kann. Ist im Orgonit das wichtigste Mineral da durch den Druck des ausgehärteten Harzes auf die Kristalle der sogenannte piezoelektrische Effekt hervorgerufen wird der für Wirkung eines gut funktionierenden Orgoniten von entschiedener Bedeutung ist.Verbaute Metalle:Kupfer, Magnesium, Blattsilber❕Dies ist eine achtseitige Pyramide mit einem Innenwinkel von 1,7 Grad, genau 1zu1 wie die große Cheops Pyramide in Gizeh erbaut wurde.Was ist an achtseitige Pyramiden anders als bei vierseitigen?Schon die alten Ägypter wussten die Wirkung von achtseitigen Pyramiden zu schätzen und erbauten deshalb viele Ihrer Bauwerke nach diesem Konzept. Nur warum? Abgesehen davon das sich durch diesen Innenwinkel das Bauwerk länger hält weißt es auch energetisch gesehen ein höheres Energiepotenzial auf als eine vierseitige Pyramide. Diese Aussage unterstützt in diesem Sinne die Theorie, dass die Pyramiden vor vielen Tausenden von Jahren als Generator bzw. Kraftwerk für freie Energie genutzt wurden. Ich möchte aber an dieser Stelle nicht tiefer darauf eingehen. (Bei Interesse können sie sich gerne etwas darüber informieren/ die Informationen sind überall zugänglich).Aufgrund dessen das also nach alter Ägyptischer Lehre dieses Prinzip für den Pyramidenbau angewendet wurde, haben sich auch diverse Größen wie Nikola Tesla und Wilhelm Reich mit dieser Materie auseinandergesetzt und sehr viel in diese Richtung geforscht.Nachdem viele Informationen zu diesem Thema gesammelt und kombiniert werden konnten, konnte man dieses uralte Wissen nun auch in den Orgonbau mit einfließen lassen.Eine achtseitige Orgon/Prana Pyramide hat somit ein viel höheres und stärkeres Energieniveau als eine vierseitige & dementsprechend auch eine viel längere Lebensdauer bevor sie endgültig “ausgebrannt“ ist und wieder reaktiviert werden muss.Die Formen der großen Pyramiden sind bis heute ein mathematisches Wunder, und genau diese Mystik steckt auch in jeder achtseitigen Orgon Pyramide und kann so auch diese Energie an seine Umwelt abgeben und sie von der heilenden Erdenergie profitieren lassen. In Kombination mit einem gepulsten Quarzkristall welcher durch einen modernen Frequenz Generator auf eine beliebige Frequenz getaktet werden kann (z.b 432hz (heilende Erdfrequenz)), erreicht das fertige Orgon Produkt sein maximales Wirkungspotenzial.Nach diesem einzigartigen Konzept werden viele unserer Produkte mit zeitaufwendiger Arbeit, Liebe, Kreativität und Herzblut hergestellt und für unsere Kunden zum Kauf angeboten. Ich bitte an dieser Stelle noch einmal zu berücksichtigen das in jedem einzelnen Orgon Produkt sehr viel Zeit, Kreativität, Kopfarbeit, Wissen in diverse Bereiche aber auch teure Materialien, aufwendige Handarbeit, stundenlanges sitzen vor dem Computer und Steuern den endgültigen Preis bilden.Selbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz. Jedes einzelne meiner Stücke ist ein Unikat und somit einzigartig.Ich schwöre auf die Echtheit der von mir angegebenen Bestandteile!Für jeden einzelnen Orgonite nehme ich mir sehr viel Zeit und stecke sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe herein. In den meisten Fällen werden meine Produkte am Tag hergestellt und die darin verarbeiteten Materialien im Sonnenlicht aufgeladen um eine optimale Wirkung zu erzielen. Gegebenenfalls werden einige Orgonite auch im Licht des Vollmondes gebadet, wenn dies der Fall ist, findest du diese Information unter den Bestandteilen. Du hast in meinem Shop auch die Möglichkeit dir dein personalisiertes Orgon-Produkt nach deinen Vorstellungen herstellen zu lassen. Dafür musst du mir nur eine Nachricht schicken in der du genauer erläuterst wie du dir dein fertiges Unikat vorstellst.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien. Das hat allerdings keine Folgen auf die Wirkung des Orgons und tritt auch nur in sehr seltenen Fällen auf. Danke für das Verständnis! :)Bei Fragen stehe ich gerne zur Verfügung!

            Energetisierungsplatte von Sonnenkraft7 - Orgon Platte z. Wasser energetisieren - Taschenorgonit - Mit Malachit & Karneol
        ","
                    Verwendung:Orgon Energetisierungsplatten wirken auf einer sehr feinen energetischen Ebene und sind dazu in der Lage auf sanfte Art und Weise z.b Wasser oder Tee zu beleben und das Schwingungsniveau zu steigern. Auf diese Weise kann das aufgeladene Wasser direkt auf unsere Zellen einwirken und unsere Selbstheilungskräfte aktivieren. Aber nicht nur als Untersetzer für Getränke ist die Platte gut geeignet, sondern auch als unterstützendes Werkzeug in der Meditation um tiefe Trance- und Entspannungszustände zu erzielen.Aufbau:Die Orgon Platte hat 6 zentrale Bergkristallspitzen verbaut welche alle mit ihrer Spitze auf den mittleren Kreis (Baum des Lebens Orgonit) ausgerichtet sind. Der mittlere Kreis ist ein Amulett mit dem Baum des Lebens Symbolik. Im Amulett sind verschiedene Bestandteile verbaut welche unten näher beschrieben werden. Bergkristalle in Ihrer natürlichen Form & guter Klarheit sind von essenzieller Bedeutung für einen gut funktionierenden Orgoniten. Der Druck des Harzes welcher beim aushärten auftritt, erzeugt den sogenannten Piezoelektrischen Effekt im Bergkristall der dessen Wirkung um ein vielfaches verstärkt. Ich habe bewusst die Zahl 6 für Anzahl der Bergkristalle gewählt da diese Zahl, eine Ordnungszahl ist und die natürliche Unendlichkeit von allem was ist repräsentiert. Auf diese Weise ist die Energie der Energetisierungsplatte eine sehr sanfte aber dennoch kraftvolle. Die Zwischenräume wurden mit Malachit & Karneol ausgefüllt. Die Schwingung der Mineralien wird von den Bergkristallspitzen aufgefangen, gespeichert, verwertet und zentriert an die Mitte abgegeben. Darauf folgend wurde ein fertiges Mineral/Metall Gemisch aus atomatisierten Metallen und zerstäubten Mineralien beigefügt welches durch die Feinheit der Bestandteile das maximale Wirkungspotenzial aus der Energetisierungsplatte hervorrufen kann. Maße:Breite = 95mmTiefe: 10mmBestandteile:Malachit = Hat starke reinigende Eigenschaften auf den gesamten Organismus, dabei wird die Seele nicht ausgeschlossen. Der Malachit soll dabei behilflich sein krankmachende und belastende Lebenseinschränkungen zu erkennen und voller Tatkraft ins positive umzukehren. Er verleiht dadurch mehr Ausgeglichenheit, Lebensfreude und Verständnis. Viele Menschen haben nach regelmäßigen Tragen des Malachits davon berichtet das sie in eine neue Lebensphase eingetreten sind welche die vorherigen Phasen in Sachen Erfolg, Zufriedenheit und Selbstverwirklichung um einiges übertroffen haben.Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Fuchsit = dient als Schutzstein bei Depressionen, Ängsten und Melancholie. Ebenso verleiht er in schwierigen Situationen & Lebenslagen ein sicheres Auftreten und hilft dabei, inneren und äußeren Druck abzuwenden. Fördert die Kreativität.Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannKarneol = Bringen gute Laune und Sonne ins Gemüt und sollen bei manchen Menschen bereits Depressionen gelindert haben. Unterstützen außerdem die Reinigungsfunktion des Körpers.Zweite Schicht enthält: Mineralien:Schungit, Pyrit, Rosenquarz, Bergkristall, Turmalin schwarz, SelenitSpezialzutat: Agnihotra AscheAtomatisierte(zerstäubte) Metalle:Kupfer, Eisen, Zink, GraphitAlle Bestandteile weisen typische und charakteristische Merkmale zum Schutz vor schädlicher elektromagnetischer Strahlung vor. Inkl. Elektrosmog, Wasseradern, geopathischer Belastung Der endgültige Preis des Produkts setzt sich aus dem Wert der Bestandteile , dem handwerklichen Aufwand, der Nachbearbeitung, Mehrwertsteuer und dem Zeitaufwand zusammen.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien.

            Obelisk Orgon Amulet of Solar Power7 - Obelisk Amulet - With Dumortierite & Bronze for Mental Stability
        ","
                Dimensions:Length: 44 mmWidth: 11 mmDepth: 11 mmComponents:Dumortierit = Should have a strong concentration-promoting and centring effect on the mind. After the mental work has been done, he should facilitate the transition to a relaxed state and provide balance and inner peace. He is also said to have hardly had a stone that can soothe and switch off the mind better than the dumortierite. According to this, it is used wherever inner blockages, nervous inner restlessness and over-stimulation can be found. During meditation it is often said that Nirvana similar states can be achieved full of balance and harmony.Rock crystal = enhances the effect of other healing stones. Stores information and releases it through its individual energy. (peaks more suitable than granules) provides clarity and order. In doing so, it supports the calming of the mental state and a more harmonious alignment with the higher self. It also protects against electrosmog and harmful interference fields.Shungite = Acts very strongly against electromagnetic radiation. (electrosmog) is able to correct torsional fields.Can be used indefinitely as it cannot ""suck"" with negative energy like other mineralsMetals:Bronze, IronChakra:Vishudda (neck chakra), Ajna (third eye)Interesting facts about the orgone amuletAll orgone amulets made by me can be used in a wide variety of ways. They are smaller and more compact than a pyramid and therefore have a lower radius of action, but still have enough potential to support its carrier continuously. Depending on the height at which the amulet is worn, it can stimulate certain areas, e.B the thyroid gland or lungs. I always recommend meditating with the orgonites and putting them on certain areas as this way achieves the best effects. Each orgone amulet receives a free adjustable hemp cord, which can be adjusted to any height. Thus, the orgonite is permanently on the desired spot and unfolds its full potential over everyday life.Everyone who likes to wear healing stone chains knows the problem of not being able to decide which stone to wear today. So you just wear 2 -4 stone chains which can be quite annoying in the long run. With my orgone amulets, all your favorite healing stones can be perfectly combined and can reach their potential for maximum effect with concentrated force within a single trailer. In addition, the effect of the orgone is added, which by the composition of resin, metals and healing stones amplifies the effect many times over and the ability to convert negative ions into positive ions. Thus, you have solved several problems and wears a beautiful and powerful pendant that accompanies you in your everyday life.Important note❕: I make all my products myself & please take into account that small beauty slacks can occur during the production of the production, such as .b air bubbles which are trapped in the resin & thus occasionally small holes are created, minimal scratches on the surface which can only be detected with close inspection or minimally standing out materials. However, this has no effect on the effect of the orgone and occurs only in very rare cases. Thank you for your understanding! :)Homemade orgone product made from various metals, minerals and epoxy resin. Each of my pieces is unique and therefore unique.I swear by the authenticity of the components I have indicated!For each individual orgonite I take a lot of time and put a lot of work and love in. In most cases, my products are made during the day and the materials processed in them are charged in sunlight for optimal effect. If necessary, some orgonites will also be bathed in the light of the full moon, if this is the case, you will find this information among the components. You also have the possibility to have your personalized orgone product made according to your ideas in my shop. All you have to do is send me a message in which you will elaborate on how to imagine your finished one-off.If I have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!

Somit liegt der Orgonit permanent auf der gewünschten Stelle auf und entfaltet über den Alltag sein volles Potenzial.Jeder der gerne Heilsteinketten trägt kennt das Problem sich nicht entscheiden zu können welchen Stein man heute trägt. Also trägt man einfach 2 -4 Steinketten was auf Dauer ziemlich störend sein kann. Durch meine Orgon Amulette lassen sich alle deine Lieblings Heilsteine perfekt miteinander kombinieren und können mit geballter Kraft innerhalb eines einzigen Anhängers ihr Wirkungspotenzial maximal entfalten. Zusätzlich kommt noch der Effekt des Orgons hinzu welcher Durch die Zusammensetzung aus Harz, Metallen und Heilsteinen den Effekt um ein Vielfaches verstärkt und die Fähigkeit, negative Ionen in Positive Ionen umwandeln zu können. Somit hat man mehrere Probleme gelöst und trägt einen wunderschönen und kraftvollen Anhänger der dich in deinem Alltag begleitet.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien. Das hat allerdings keine Folgen auf die Wirkung des Orgons und tritt auch nur in sehr seltenen Fällen auf. Danke für das Verständnis! :)Selbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz. Jedes einzelne meiner Stücke ist ein Unikat und somit einzigartig.Ich schwöre auf die Echtheit der von mir angegebenen Bestandteile!Für jeden einzelnen Orgonite nehme ich mir sehr viel Zeit und stecke sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe herein.

They are smaller and more compact than a pyramid and therefore have a lower radius of action, but still have enough potential to support its carrier continuously. Depending on the height at which the amulet is worn, it can stimulate certain areas, e.B the thyroid gland or lungs. I always recommend meditating with the orgonites and putting them on certain areas as this way achieves the best effects. Each orgone amulet receives a free adjustable hemp cord, which can be adjusted to any height. Thus, the orgonite is permanently on the desired spot and unfolds its full potential over everyday life.Everyone who likes to wear healing stone chains knows the problem of not being able to decide which stone to wear today. So you just wear 2 -4 stone chains which can be quite annoying in the long run. With my orgone amulets, all your favorite healing stones can be perfectly combined and can reach their potential for maximum effect with concentrated force within a single trailer. In addition, the effect of the orgone is added, which by the composition of resin, metals and healing stones amplifies the effect many times over and the ability to convert negative ions into positive ions. Thus, you have solved several problems and wears a beautiful and powerful pendant that accompanies you in your everyday life.Important note❕: I make all my products myself & please take into account that small beauty slacks can occur during the production of the production, such as .b air bubbles which are trapped in the resin & thus occasionally small holes are created, minimal scratches on the surface which can only be detected with close inspection or minimally standing out materials.

Man sollte dabei nur daran denken das der Ort an dem Die Platte getragen wird, der sein wird an dem sie am stärksten wirkt. Die Orgon Platte kann allerdings auch am Arbeitsplatz aufgestellt oder ins Auto gelegt werden. Überall wo sie sich befindet arbeitet sie daran energetische Unstimmigkeiten auszugleichen.Durch das Zusammenspiel von Skalar-Energie, Symbolik und Steinheilkunde erreicht diese Platte ein hohes energetisches Potenzial.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien.

            Sri Yantra - Energetisierungsplatte von Sonnenkraft7 - Orgon Platte zum Wasser energetisieren - Orgon Untersetzer
        ","
                    Verwendung:Orgon Energetisierungsplatten wirken auf einer sehr feinen energetischen Ebene und sind dazu in der Lage auf sanfte Art und Weise z.b Wasser oder Tee zu beleben und das Schwingungsniveau zu steigern. Auf diese Weise kann das aufgeladene Wasser direkt auf unsere Zellen einwirken und unsere Selbstheilungskräfte aktivieren. Aber nicht nur als Untersetzer für Getränke ist die Platte gut geeignet, sondern auch als unterstützendes Werkzeug in der Meditation um tiefe Trance- und Entspannungszustände zu erzielen. Aufbau: Die Orgon Platte hat 6 zentrale Bergkristallspitzen verbaut welche alle mit ihrer Spitze auf den mittleren Kreis (Sri Yantra Orgonit) ausgerichtet sind. Der mittlere Kreis ist ein Amulett mit der Sri Yantra Symbolik. Im Amulett sind verschiedene Bestandteile verbaut welche unten näher beschrieben werden. Bergkristalle in Ihrer natürlichen Form & guter Klarheit sind von essenzieller Bedeutung für einen gut funktionierenden Orgoniten. Der Druck des Harzes welcher beim aushärten auftritt, erzeugt den sogenannten Piezoelektrischen Effekt im Bergkristall der dessen Wirkung um ein vielfaches verstärkt. Ich habe bewusst die Zahl 6 für Anzahl der Bergkristalle gewählt da diese Zahl, eine Ordnungszahl ist und die natürliche Unendlichkeit von allem was ist repräsentiert. Auf diese Weise ist die Energie der Energetisierungsplatte eine sehr sanfte aber dennoch kraftvolle. Die Zwischenräume wurden mit Larimar & Mondstein ausgefüllt. Die Schwingung der Mineralien wird von den Bergkristallspitzen aufgefangen, gespeichert, verwertet und zentriert an die Mitte abgegeben. Darauf folgend wurden Metalle und Bergkristallpulver hinzugegeben um den Effekt des Orgoniten zu perfektionieren. Ein starker Orgonit funktioniert nur dann sehr gut, wenn ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis von Metallen und Mineralien vorliegt, nicht zu vergessen ist hierbei die Wichtigkeit des Bergkristalls! Maße:Breite = 95mmTiefe: 10mmBestandteile:Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Larimar = Schutzstein vor negativen Einflüssen welche durch falsche Freunde oder Untreue zu uns kommen. Soll das Selbstbewusstsein, Selbstvertrauen und die Inspiration steigern. Lindert Angst vor drohendem Unheil, dunklen Vorahnungen, Wahnvorstellungen unbegründeten Sorgen und übermäßigen Aberglauben. Zudem soll sich der Larimar gut auf die Knochen und das Skelett auswirken da es Kalzium-Natrium Silikat ist. Gut bei Verkrampfungen und Muskelbeschwerden. Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannPyrit = Seit dem Mittelalter ist bei vielen Medizinern bekannt das der Pyrit verschiedene Körpersäfte zu steuern vermag. Er hat durch seine metallischen Eigenschaften eine sehr leitende und reinigende Wirkung auf den Körper. Löst Blockaden und befreit uns von Ängsten.

            Sri Yantra - Energetisierungsplatte von Sonnenkraft7 - Orgon Platte zum Wasser energetisieren - Orgonit Untersetzer - Wasser Strukturierung
        ","
                    Symbolik:Verwendung:Orgon Energetisierungsplatten wirken auf einer sehr feinen energetischen Ebene und sind dazu in der Lage auf sanfte Art und Weise z.b Wasser oder Tee zu beleben und das Schwingungsniveau zu steigern. Auf diese Weise kann das aufgeladene Wasser direkt auf unsere Zellen einwirken und unsere Selbstheilungskräfte aktivieren. Aber nicht nur als Untersetzer für Getränke ist die Platte gut geeignet, sondern auch als unterstützendes Werkzeug in der Meditation um tiefe Trance- und Entspannungszustände zu erzielen.Aufbau:Die Orgon Platte hat 6 zentrale Bergkristallspitzen verbaut welche alle mit ihrer Spitze leicht nach rechts geneigt auf die mittlere Symbolik (Sri Yantra Orgonplatte) ausgerichtet sind. Das bildet ebenfalls ein rechtstorsierendes Energiefeld erzeugt mit der Ausrichtung der Bergkristalle. Dies ist möglich weil, die Bergkristallspitzen Ihre Energie über die Spitze abgeben. Der mittlere Kreis bezeichnet eine Orgon Platte mit der Sri Yantra Symbolik, welches eines der ältesten Symbole der Menschheit ist. In der Platte sind verschiedene Bestandteile verbaut welche unten näher beschrieben werden. Bergkristalle in Ihrer natürlichen Form & guter Klarheit sind von essenzieller Bedeutung für einen gut funktionierenden Orgoniten. Der Druck des Harzes welcher beim aushärten auftritt, erzeugt den sogenannten Piezoelektrischen Effekt im Bergkristall der dessen Wirkung um ein vielfaches verstärkt. Ich habe bewusst die Zahl 6 für Anzahl der Bergkristalle gewählt da diese Zahl, eine Ordnungszahl ist und die natürliche Unendlichkeit von allem was ist repräsentiert. Auf diese Weise ist die Energie der Energetisierungsplatte eine sehr sanfte aber dennoch kraftvolle. Die Zwischenräume wurden mit braunem Tektit (Meteoritenglas) & Bronze ausgefüllt. Außerdem bildet grüne Jade einen Kreis um die Symbolik. Die Schwingung der Mineralien wird von den Bergkristallspitzen aufgefangen, gespeichert, verwertet und zentriert an die Mitte abgegeben. Darauf folgend wurden Metalle und Bergkristallpulver hinzugegeben um den Effekt des Orgoniten zu perfektionieren. Ein starker Orgonit funktioniert nur dann sehr gut, wenn ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis von Metallen und Mineralien vorliegt, nicht zu vergessen ist hierbei die Wichtigkeit des Bergkristalls!Maße:Breite = 152mmTiefe: 11mmBestandteile:Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern.Schungit = Wirkt sehr stark gegen elektromagnetische Strahlung. (Elektrosmog) ist in der Lage Torsionsfelder zu korrigieren.Kann unbegrenzt eingesetzt werden da er sich nicht wie andere Mineralien mit negativer Energie „vollsaugen“ kannGrüne Jade = Seit Gedenken der Menschen ist die grüne Jade einer der besten Heilsteine gegen Erschöpfung, Schwäche und Müdigkeit. Soll sowohl bei körperlicher Erschöpfung als auch bei geistiger Erschöpfung behilflich sein.Brauner Tektit (Meteoritenglas) = Fördert Selbsterkenntnis,Bewusstheit & Heilung. Fördert neue Ideen und verbessert die Aufmerksamkeit, kann außerdem den Schlaf verbessern & bei Schlafstörungen helfen.Folgende Metalle sind enthalten:Bronze, Magnesium, KupferDer endgültige Preis des Produkts setzt sich aus dem Wert der Bestandteile, dem handwerklichen Aufwand, der Nachbearbeitung, Mehrwertsteuer und dem Zeitaufwand zusammen.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien.

            Ankh - Ägyptisches Orgon Amulett v. Sonnenkraft- Für Motivation & Optimismus
        ","
                    Symbolik: Ankh - Das Ankh Symbol wurde von den alten Ägyptern dafür verwendet sich vor dem Bösen zu schützen und negative Einflüsse abzuwenden. Wissenschaftler haben herausgefunden das es älter ist als das Christentum, weshalb man sich nun vorstellen kann das die Christen sich die Symbolik des Ankh als Inspiration für Ihre eigene genutzt haben könnten. Deswegen wird dem Ankh auch die Bezeichnung ""Die Mutter der Kreuze"" zugeschrieben.

Sie sind kleiner und kompakter als eine Pyramide und haben demnach einen niedrigeren Wirkradius, aber immernoch genug Potenzial um seinen Träger stetig zu unterstützen. Je nachdem auf welcher Höhe das Amulett getragen wird kann es bestimmte Bereiche stimulieren, z.B die Schilddrüse oder die Lungen. Ich empfehle immer mit den Orgoniten zu meditieren und sie auf bestimmte Bereiche aufzulegen da man auf diese Weise die besten Effekte erzielt. Jedes Orgon Amulett erhält eine kostenlose Verstellbare Hanfschnur dazu, welche auf jede Höhe angepasst werden kann. Somit liegt der Orgonit permanent auf der gewünschten Stelle auf und entfaltet über den Alltag sein volles Potenzial.Jeder der gerne Heilsteinketten trägt kennt das Problem sich nicht entscheiden zu können welchen Stein man heute trägt. Also trägt man einfach 2 -4 Steinketten was auf Dauer ziemlich störend sein kann. Durch meine Orgon Amulette lassen sich alle deine Lieblings Heilsteine perfekt miteinander kombinieren und können mit geballter Kraft innerhalb eines einzigen Anhängers ihr Wirkungspotenzial maximal entfalten. Zusätzlich kommt noch der Effekt des Orgons hinzu welcher Durch die Zusammensetzung aus Harz, Metallen und Heilsteinen den Effekt um ein Vielfaches verstärkt und die Fähigkeit, negative Ionen in Positive Ionen umwandeln zu können. Somit hat man mehrere Probleme gelöst und trägt einen wunderschönen und kraftvollen Anhänger der dich in deinem Alltag begleitet.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien.

Fördert neue Ideen und verbessert die Aufmerksamkeit, kann außerdem den Schlaf verbessern & bei Schlafstörungen helfen. Turmalin (Schörl) = Der Turmalin darf in einem Orgon Amulett auf keinen Fall fehlen. Er sorgt für Schutz vor negativer Energie und schädlichen Strahlungen aller  Art. ( Elektrosmog inbegriffen ) Schützt zudem vor bösen Absichten anderen Menschen und bringt die eigene aus dem Gleichgewicht geratene Gedankenstruktur wieder in Harmonie. Aktiviert die Energiemeridiane und somit auch das jeweilige Chakra auf dem er aufliegt. Bergkristall = verstärkt die Wirkung anderer Heilsteine. Speichert Informationen und gibt diese durch seine individuelle Energie wieder ab. (Spitzen besser geeignet als Granulat) verschafft Klarheit und Ordnung. Er unterstützt damit die Beruhigung des seelischen Zustands und eine harmonischere Ausrichtung am höheren Selbst. Ebenso schützt er vor Elektrosmog und schädlichen Störfeldern. Pyrit = lässt über sich selbst nachdenken um die eigenen Schwächen besser erkennen und transformieren zu können. Somit können Blockaden u. Ängste gelindert werden. Löst innere Unruhe und Nervosität Selenit = Starke klärende Wirkung auf das vegetative Nervensystem (Verstand und Gehirn). Fördert Vitalität und Kreativität.Fluorit (grün) = Wirkt besonders heilsam auf Lungen und Atemwege. Fördert Intuition, Konzentration und Aufnahmefähigkeit.

Soll besonders die Seelen von Kindern vor negativen Übergriffen schützen weshalb es sich empfiehlt den Kindern immer einen Rosenquarz mitzugeben. Er verleiht Herzenswärme und Stärke und schützt zudem vor geopathischen Belastungen wie Elektrosmog und Wasseradern. Soll bei der Steigerung des Selbstwertgefühls behilflich sein. Verbaute Metalle: Bronze, Eisen, Edelstahl, Blattgold, Blattsilber, Aluminium, Zink, Kupfer, MagnesiumFrequenzen:396 Hz: Verströmt positive Energie, wirkt befreiend auf Angst und Schuld, hilft gegen Trauer und löst Blockaden. Zudem verhilft sie dazu gesetzte Ziele leichter zu erreichen ohne sich von diversen Widerständen aus der Bahn werfen zu lassen. Negative Gedanken und negative Verhaltensmuster können somit geklärt werden. Soll unter anderem in manchen Fällen Trauer in Freude verwandelt haben.417 Hz: Hilft bei der Verarbeitung traumatischer Ereignisse und beim Umgang mit Veränderungen. Kann emotionale Blockaden auflösen und für einen mentalen Kraftschub sorgen. Steht im allgemeinen für Veränderung. Beste Frequenz zur Traumabewältigung.528 Hz: Dieser Frequenz wird eine ganz besondere heilende Wirkung zugesprochen, da Versuche und Forschungen im Bereich der Molekularbiologie ergeben haben, dass mit Hilfe dieser Frequenz es möglich ist, eine defekte bzw. beschädigte DNA zu reparieren. Die Frequenz steht für Transformation, Wunder und Zeichen und ist in der Lage, auf unser Erbgut einzuwirken. Im alternativmedizinischem Bereich wird die Frequenz häufig dafür verwendet, unsere menschliche DNA in den ursprünglichen Zustand zurückzuversetzen. Was wiederum dafür sorgt, dass mehr Lebensenergie zur Verfügung steht, das Bewusstsein erwacht und klarer sowie die Kreativität entfacht wird. Zustände von innerem Frieden können unter anderem erreicht werden, ebenso wie die Aktivierung von Phantasie, Intention und Intuition. Diese Frequenz verfügt über ein enormes Potential, um das Leben auf jeder Ebene positiv zu beeinflussen.639 Hz: Harmonische Wirkung, die zu innerer Balance führt. Wirkt sich sehr gut auf das gesellschaftliche Zusammenleben aus.

Sorgt für innere Ruhe und tiefe Gelassenheit.963hz: Ist die Frequenz der göttlichen Harmonie, die in jedem System seinen ursprünglichen, perfekten Zustand erweckt. Es steht für das verlassen der unteren materiellen Ebene. Sie stellt eine Verbindung zwischen Mensch, Geist und den Energien der geistigen Welt her, um die wahre Natur und Einheit mit allem was existiert zu erleben.❕Dies ist eine achtseitige Pyramide mit einem Innenwinkel von 1,7 Grad, genau 1zu1 wie die große Cheops Pyramide in Gizeh erbaut wurde.Was ist an achtseitige Pyramiden anders als bei vierseitigen? Schon die alten Ägypter wussten die Wirkung von achtseitigen Pyramiden zu schätzen und erbauten deshalb viele Ihrer Bauwerke nach diesem Konzept. Nur warum? Abgesehen davon das sich durch diesen Innenwinkel das Bauwerk länger hält weißt es auch energetisch gesehen ein höheres Energiepotenzial auf als eine vierseitige Pyramide. Diese Aussage unterstützt in diesem Sinne die Theorie, dass die Pyramiden vor vielen Tausenden von Jahren als Generator bzw. Kraftwerk für freie Energie genutzt wurden. Ich möchte aber an dieser Stelle nicht tiefer darauf eingehen. (Bei Interesse können sie sich gerne etwas darüber informieren/ die Informationen sind überall zugänglich).Aufgrund dessen das also nach alter Ägyptischer Lehre dieses Prinzip für den Pyramidenbau angewendet wurde, haben sich auch diverse Größen wie Nikola Tesla und Wilhelm Reich mit dieser Materie auseinandergesetzt und sehr viel in diese Richtung geforscht. Nachdem viele Informationen zu diesem Thema gesammelt und kombiniert werden konnten, konnte man dieses uralte Wissen nun auch in den Orgonbau mit einfließen lassen. Eine achtseitige Orgon/Prana Pyramide hat somit ein viel höheres und stärkeres Energieniveau als eine vierseitige & dementsprechend auch eine viel längere Lebensdauer bevor sie endgültig “ausgebrannt“ ist und wieder reaktiviert werden muss. Die Formen der großen Pyramiden sind bis heute ein mathematisches Wunder, und genau diese Mystik steckt auch in jeder achtseitigen Orgon Pyramide und kann so auch diese Energie an seine Umwelt abgeben und sie von der heilenden Erdenergie profitieren lassen. In Kombination mit einem gepulsten Quarzkristall welcher durch einen modernen Frequenz Generator auf eine beliebige Frequenz getaktet werden kann (z.b 432hz (heilende Erdfrequenz)), erreicht das fertige Orgon Produkt sein maximales Wirkungspotenzial. Nach diesem einzigartigen Konzept werden viele unserer Produkte mit zeitaufwendiger Arbeit, Liebe, Kreativität und Herzblut hergestellt und für unsere Kunden zum Kauf angeboten. Ich bitte an dieser Stelle noch einmal zu berücksichtigen das in jedem einzelnen Orgon Produkt sehr viel Zeit, Kreativität, Kopfarbeit, Wissen in diverse Bereiche aber auch teure Materialien, aufwendige Handarbeit, stundenlanges sitzen vor dem Computer und Steuern den endgültigen Preis bilden. Selbst hergestelltes Orgon-Produkt aus verschiedenen Metallen, Mineralien und Epoxidharz. Jedes einzelne meiner Stücke ist ein Unikat und somit einzigartig. Ich schwöre auf die Echtheit der von mir angegebenen Bestandteile!Für jeden einzelnen Orgonite nehme ich mir sehr viel Zeit und stecke sehr viel Arbeit und Liebe herein. In den meisten Fällen werden meine Produkte am Tag hergestellt und die darin verarbeiteten Materialien im Sonnenlicht aufgeladen um eine optimale Wirkung zu erzielen. Gegebenenfalls werden einige Orgonite auch im Licht des Vollmondes gebadet, wenn dies der Fall ist, findest du diese Information unter den Bestandteilen. Du hast in meinem Shop auch die Möglichkeit dir dein personalisiertes Orgon-Produkt nach deinen Vorstellungen herstellen zu lassen. Dafür musst du mir nur eine Nachricht schicken in der du genauer erläuterst wie du dir dein fertiges Unikat vorstellst.Wichtige Anmerkung❕: Ich stelle alle meine Produkte selbst von Hand her & bitte zu berücksichtigen das bei der Herstellung hin & wieder kleine Schönheitsmakel auftreten können, wie z.b Luftblasen welche ins Harz eingeschlossen werden & somit gelegentlich kleine Löcher entstehen, minimale Kratzer an der Oberfläche welche nur bei genauen Betrachten entdeckt werden können oder minimal heraus stehende Materialien. Das hat allerdings keine Folgen auf die Wirkung des Orgons und tritt auch nur in sehr seltenen Fällen auf. Danke für das Verständnis! :)Bei Fragen stehe ich gerne zur Verfügung!
