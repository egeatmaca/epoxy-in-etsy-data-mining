# Statistical Analysis of Epoxy Resin Products in Etsy

In this project I am doing an end to end statistical analysis using A/B tests, chi square tests and clustering to find out 
 - Which epoxy resin products should we sell?
 - Which features should our product have?
 
All the data in this repository are scraped by me at the end of November 2020.
Everyone is welcome to fork code or use the data :)

I would also be happy, if you contact me in case you have any advancement suggestions for the analysis.
